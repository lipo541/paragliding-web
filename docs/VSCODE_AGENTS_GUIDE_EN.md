# VS Code Agents - Complete Guide

## What are VS Code Agents?

VS Code agents are AI-powered assistants that help you with coding and development processes. They represent the new generation of GitHub Copilot and provide more intelligent and context-aware assistance.

## Types of Agents

### 1. **@workspace** Agent
- **Purpose**: Understanding the entire project context
- **When to use**: 
  - When you need information about the whole project
  - When searching for files or code sections
  - When performing refactoring across the project

**Examples**:
```
@workspace where is the booking component defined?
@workspace how do I perform SEO optimization in this project?
```

### 2. **@vscode** Agent
- **Purpose**: Working with VS Code editor settings and features
- **When to use**:
  - Configuration settings
  - Understanding shortcuts
  - Installing extensions

**Examples**:
```
@vscode how do I set up automatic formatting on save?
@vscode which extensions do I need for React?
```

### 3. **@terminal** Agent
- **Purpose**: Executing commands in the terminal
- **When to use**:
  - Building and testing code
  - Git operations
  - Installing packages

**Examples**:
```
@terminal run tests and show results
@terminal install axios and update package.json
```

## Benefits of Agents for Our Project

### 1. **Fast Code Navigation**
Next.js projects can have complex structures. Agents help you:
- Quickly find components
- Identify API routes
- Understand Supabase integration

### 2. **Code Quality Improvement**
- Automatic refactoring suggestions
- Code style consistency
- Security issue detection

### 3. **Documentation Generation**
- Automatic JSDoc comments
- README file updates
- TypeScript type documentation

## Practical Examples for Our Project

### Example 1: Working with Booking System
```
User: @workspace how does the booking system work?
Agent: The booking system is structured as follows:
- /app/booking/page.tsx - main booking page
- /components/booking/ - booking components
- /lib/supabase/bookings.ts - Supabase integration
```

### Example 2: SEO Optimization
```
User: @workspace how do I add meta tags to a new page?
Agent: In this project, meta tags are used as follows:
- Use Next.js Metadata API
- See example in app/[locale]/layout.tsx
- Different meta tags for Georgian and English versions
```

### Example 3: Creating a Component
```
User: @workspace create a new card component with glass morphism style
Agent: [Creates component according to GLASS_MORPHISM_GUIDE.md]
```

## How to Start Working with Agents

### 1. **Activation**
- Ensure you have GitHub Copilot Chat extension installed
- Open Chat panel (`Ctrl+Alt+I` or `Cmd+Alt+I`)

### 2. **Asking Effective Questions**
**Good examples**:
```
@workspace where is user authentication defined?
@workspace how do I add a new location to the locations list?
@workspace what is the glass morphism style convention in this project?
```

**Bad examples**:
```
How do I code? (too general)
Write me a program (no context)
```

### 3. **Maximizing Usage**
- **Be specific**: Mention file names or components
- **Use context**: Specify what type of help you need
- **Iterate**: If the answer doesn't help, rephrase your question

## Best Practices for Working with Agents

### 1. **Code Review**
```
@workspace review this file and give me suggestions for improvement
```

### 2. **Bug Finding**
```
@workspace why isn't this component working correctly?
```

### 3. **Understanding Documentation**
```
@workspace explain how the useAuth hook works
```

### 4. **Refactoring**
```
@workspace convert this component to TypeScript
```

## Limitations and Tips

### Limitations:
- Agents are not 100% accurate
- They cannot access resources outside the project
- Working with large files can be slow

### Tips:
- ✅ Always review code generated by agents
- ✅ Use agents for learning and understanding
- ✅ Spend time on well-formulated questions
- ❌ Don't fully trust automatic generation
- ❌ Don't use for sensitive information
